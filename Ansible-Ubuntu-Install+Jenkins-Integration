### Jenkins-Ansible Integration-Ubuntu ###
------------------------------------------

Step 1: Update System Packages
Before installing Ansible, ensure your system is up to date:

 sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Add Ansible’s Official PPA Repository
The default Ubuntu repository may have an older version of Ansible. To get the latest stable release, add the official Ansible PPA:

 sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
 sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible

This ensures your system pulls Ansible from the official Ansible project repository.

Step 3: Install Ansible
Once the PPA is added, install Ansible:

 sudo apt install ansible -y

Step 4: Verify Ansible Installation
After installation, confirm that Ansible is installed correctly:

 ansible --version

You should see output similar to:

ansible [core 2.15.2]
config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
python version = 3.10

If this works, Ansible is successfully installed!


Setting Up Ansible for Jenkins
------------------------------

Now that Ansible is installed, let's configure it for Jenkins:

Step 5: Install Ansible Plugin in Jenkins

Open Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins
Search for Ansible Plugin
Install and restart Jenkins

Step 6: Configure Ansible in Jenkins

Open Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration
Scroll down to Ansible
Click Add Ansible
Set Name (e.g., ansible or ansible-latest or any)
Set Path to Ansible: /usr/bin/
Click Save

Inside your Ansible YAML Playbook
- name: This is the playbook for installing httpd,copy, and restart the service
  hosts: all
  become: yes   ### Enables sudo privileges for all tasks ### <<<------------------
  tasks:

OR

Step 7: Allow Jenkins to Use Ansible Without sudo Password
Since Jenkins runs as a system user, it needs passwordless sudo access to execute Ansible commands:
sudo visudo

Add the following line at the end:
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ansible-playbook
This allows the Jenkins user to run Ansible playbooks without asking for a password.

Testing Ansible with Jenkins
Step 8: Run a Test Ansible Playbook in Jenkins
Create a simple Jenkins Job that executes an Ansible playbook.
Open Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Freestyle Project
Scroll to Build → Add build step → Invoke Ansible Playbook
Enter:
Playbook Path: /var/lib/jenkins/playbooks/test.yml
Inventory Path: /etc/ansible/hosts
Click Save and Build Now

In GitHub:

1.	Create a Git repo:
2.	Add your playbook-name.yml files
3.	Add your inventory-file-name.inv files
4.	Create Jenkins pipeline stages to clone git & execute Ansible
